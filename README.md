## Overview of Modules

Review of the System ('system_evulation.py')

- Goal: Use survey research to look at a system that works like predictive policing.
- **Key points**:
  - Look at how familiar people are with predictive police.
  - Figure out how much the normal person knows about predictive policing.
  – Check how much people believe the system works to reduce crime.
  - Figure out how comfortable you are using the system.
  - Figure out how likely it is that the system will be used regularly.
  — Find out what worries most people have about the system.
  See if there are any links between learning, comfort, and likely usage.

Number 2: Survey Calculation ('survey_calculation.py')

The goal is to look at survey data about people's situational knowledge and how safe they think they are.
- **Key points**:
  — Give detailed numbers about safety and knowledge.
  – Show how safety and knowledge are ranked by age group and city population.
  — Display the amounts needed for safety studies and the most effective ways to raise awareness.
  - Make graphs showing how age, awareness, and safety scores are related.

3. Analysis of Crime Data ("crime_data.py")

- *Purpose*: Analyse and process crime data from several CSV files.
- **Key points**:
  - Sort the crime data by the year and the police station that reported it.
  — Figure out and see how often different types of crimes happen.
  - Keep gathered info and visualisations for later use.

## Technology Setup

- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: pandas
