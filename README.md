## Modules Overview

### 1. System Evaluation (`system_evulation.py`)

- **Purpose**: Evaluate a system similar to predictive policing through survey analysis.
- **Key Features**:
  - Analyze familiarity with predictive policing.
  - Measure average understanding of predictive policing.
  - Assess belief in the system's efficacy in reducing crime.
  - Gauge comfort level with the system's usage.
  - Determine likelihood of regular system usage.
  - Identify prevalent concerns about the system.
  - Visualize correlations between understanding, comfort, and usage likelihood.

### 2. Survey Calculation (`survey_calculation.py`)

- **Purpose**: Analyze survey data on individual's situational awareness and perceived safety levels.
- **Key Features**:
  - Provide descriptive statistics for awareness and safety.
  - Offer breakdowns of awareness and safety by age and city demographics.
  - Showcase proportions for safety research and preferred awareness strategies.
  - Visualize correlations between age, awareness, and safety ratings.

### 3. Crime Data Analysis (`crime_data.py`)

- **Purpose**: Process and analyze crime data sourced from multiple CSV files.
- **Key Features**:
  - Group crime data by reporting police station and year.
  - Calculate and visualize frequency of various crime types.
  - Save aggregated data and visualizations for further use.
